EDIT: Incomplete and entirely obsolete at this point. I'm not looking back at this code and likely you shouldn't either.

Complete rewrite of PixelOranges' MARS from scratch, eventually. First focusing on rewriting the core (mostly done) and increasing robustness. Oh, and cutting out the most of the modularity. It generally didn't make it any easier to repurpose the code, anyway (From what I could tell).

Currently has some chunks of MARS' code, will excise it soon (I hope).
